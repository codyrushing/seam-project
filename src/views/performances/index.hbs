        This piece touches on the loneliness that our modern society has generated through technology, specifically app-dating culture and the fruition of &quot;ghosting.&quot;

### Hailley Lauren
#### Left Hand Path
This piece explores the use of dance as a means of invocation. I am interested in the harnessing of energy that occurs when movement is fully expressed physically and with a specific purpose as a means to transcend this plane of existence and enter into the next. Finding the space between worlds is where the magic happens. This piece is a collaboration between myself, composer Cody Cook and animator Sebastian Bisbal.

### Rachael Hanlon
The work I am creating is an exploration of energy and flow. It is a study in the subtle shifts in our experience and how we redirect our energy. Iâ€™m curious about how we remain grounded yet malleable in a constant state of flux.

Practice this:
Do not name what you see or hear. Do not assign a value to what you perceive. Only see and hear and smell and feel and realize you exist in the same space as what you perceive.
