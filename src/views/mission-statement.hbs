The Seam Project is the vision of a multi-disciplinary team of artists seeking to connect their work to the neighborhoods they live in, give to, and thrive from.

The Seam Project consists of four shows in four months, with each gathering showcasing the work of four to eight neighborhood artists and their collaborators on a 4x4 stage in the yard of a house.

Each home has been selected by the region of Austin in which it sits, (South, North, West, and East.) Each show's mission is to bring performances directly to the people who live in the corresponding neighborhoods of these homes and to forge a closer knit network of community.

Our first show, South, will be at 8 PM on Saturday, September 15th and will showcase the work of Emily Rushing, Cody Rushing, Yvonne Keyrouz, Judd Farris, Nathan Patterson,  Taryn Lavery, Katie Gunderson, Rosalyn Nasky.

The goal set for this fundraiser reflects The Seam Project's belief in paying artists for their work and creating a comprehensively memorable experience for the audience.

The money raised from this campaign will go directly to the stipend of the contributing artists and amenities for patrons such as drinks, comfortable seating, and quality facilities.

Any funds raised beyond our set goal will go immediately to the next project in this cycle,  North, set to open in October.

The ultimate goal of The Seam Project is not only to bring performances to communities, but to generate and cultivate work by the people in the community to better understand their experience as a citizen of Austin and their neighborhood. The next phase of Seam Project will begin in the second year of production.

All donations are greatly appreciated and we hope to see you one or all of our shows!

Thank you.

Best Regards,
The Artists of The Seam Project
